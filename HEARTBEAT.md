## CRITIC Mode Loop
Continue the CRITIC mode loop: critically examine the Ragamuffin codebase against the game spec. Pick the most impactful improvement, implement it, build, test, commit, and push. Then report what you did. Focus areas: gameplay mechanics, world detail, UI polish, missing features from the spec (punch trees, dodge police, build shelter from cardboard, raid Greggs, British town survival). Commit and push after each improvement.

## After Every Commit
After every successful `git push origin main`, you MUST send a WhatsApp message to the group using the message tool:

```
message channel:"whatsapp" to:"120363423216640120@g.us" text:"your summary here"
```

Keep the summary brief (2-4 sentences). Be Reg about it. Include what you changed and that it has been pushed.
