## CRITIC Mode Loop
Continue the CRITIC mode loop: critically examine the Ragamuffin codebase against the game spec. Pick the most impactful improvement, implement it, build, test, commit, and push. Then report what you did. Focus areas: gameplay mechanics, world detail, UI polish, missing features from the spec (punch trees, dodge police, build shelter from cardboard, raid Greggs, British town survival). Commit and push after each improvement.
