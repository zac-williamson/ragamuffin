BUG: Large parts of the ground have no chunk data loaded

When playing the game, large sections of the terrain are missing — empty voids where
ground should be. Every chunk that has data in it appears to be surrounded by empty
chunks with no block data. This creates a checkerboard-like pattern where roughly half
the world is just missing.

Expected: All chunks in the world should be fully populated with terrain data. The 
ground should be continuous with no gaps. Walking around, you should see solid terrain
in every direction, not alternating loaded/empty chunks.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start a new game
2. Look around — large patches of the ground are just missing
3. Walk around and observe the pattern: loaded chunks alternate with empty ones
