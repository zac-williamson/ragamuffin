BUG: Camera can be turned upside down

The player can rotate the camera beyond vertical limits by moving the mouse up or down
continuously. This allows the camera to flip completely upside down, which is disorienting
and breaks gameplay. There are no pitch limits on the first-person camera.

Expected: The camera pitch should be clamped so the player cannot look further than
straight up (90 degrees) or straight down (-90 degrees). This is standard FPS camera
behaviour — the camera should stop at the vertical limits and not flip over.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start a new game
2. Move the mouse upward continuously
3. The camera rotates past looking straight up and flips upside down
4. Same happens when looking down — no limit on pitch rotation
