BUG: Newly loaded chunks never get their meshes built

In RagamuffinGame.updatePlaying() (line 485), world.updateLoadedChunks() is called every frame as the player moves. This correctly loads new chunk data. However, updateChunkRenderers() is NOT called afterwards during normal gameplay.

updateChunkRenderers() is only called:
- Once during create() (line 133) — initial load
- When a block is broken (line 572)
- When a block is placed (line 607)

So as the player walks around, new chunks get loaded with block data (you can mine them) but their meshes are never built, making them invisible.

Fix: Call updateChunkRenderers() after world.updateLoadedChunks() in updatePlaying(), or better yet, track which chunks are new/dirty and only rebuild those.
