BUG: Mining certain blocks gives item named "???"

When mining invisible ground blocks, at least one block type shows as "???" in the inventory/hotbar. This means the block type from the world does not have a proper display name or Material mapping in the drop table.

This likely affects STONE or DIRT blocks (the base terrain layers) which may not have a corresponding entry in BlockDropTable or the Material enum.

Expected: All mineable block types should produce a properly named item in the inventory.
