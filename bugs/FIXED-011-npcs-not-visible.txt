BUG: NPCs are not visible in the game world

Despite NPCs being spawned in the code, none are visible when playing the game. Either they are not being rendered, or they are spawning underground/inside blocks, or the NPC rendering system is broken.

For testing purposes: spawn one NPC of EVERY type (PUBLIC, DOG, YOUTH_GANG, COUNCIL_MEMBER, POLICE) within 10 blocks of the player start position at y=2 (above ground level) so they are immediately visible and testable when the game starts. Place them in a line in front of the player so they are all in view.
